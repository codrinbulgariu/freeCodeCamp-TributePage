            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>
              Gregor Johann Mendel was born Johann Mendel on July 22, 1822, to
              Anton and Rosine Mendel, on his family’s farm, in what was then
              Heinzendorf, Austria. He spent his early youth in that rural
              setting, until age 11, when a local schoolmaster who was impressed
              with his aptitude for learning recommended that he be sent to
              secondary school in Troppau to continue his education. The move
              was a financial strain on his family, and often a difficult
              experience for Mendel, but he excelled in his studies, and in
              1840, he graduated from the school with honors.

            <h3>Experiments</h3>
            <p>
              Around 1854, Mendel began to research the transmission of
              hereditary traits in plant hybrids. At the time of Mendel’s
              studies, it was a generally accepted fact that the hereditary
              traits of the offspring of any species were merely the diluted
              blending of whatever traits were present in the “parents.” It was
              also commonly accepted that, over generations, a hybrid would
              revert to its original form, the implication of which suggested
              that a hybrid could not create new forms. However, the results of
              such studies were often skewed by the relatively short period of
              time during which the experiments were conducted, whereas Mendel’s
              research continued over as many as eight years (between 1856 and
              1863), and involved tens of thousands of individual plants.

            <h3>Theories</h3>
            <p>
              Mendel chose to use peas for his experiments due to their many
              distinct varieties, and because offspring could be quickly and
              easily produced. He cross-fertilized pea plants that had clearly
              opposite characteristics—tall with short, smooth with wrinkled,
              those containing green seeds with those containing yellow seeds,
              etc.—and, after analyzing his results, reached two of his most
              important conclusions: the Law of Segregation, which established
              that there are dominant and recessive traits passed on randomly
              from parents to offspring (and provided an alternative to blending
              inheritance, the dominant theory of the time), and the Law of
              Independent Assortment, which established that traits were passed
              on independently of other traits from parent to offspring. He also
              proposed that this heredity followed basic statistical laws.
              Though Mendel’s experiments had been conducted with pea plants, he
              put forth the theory that all living things had such traits.

            <h3>Later Life, Death and Legacy</h3>
            <p>
              In 1868, Mendel was elected abbot of the school where he had been
              teaching for the previous 14 years, and both his resulting
              administrative duties and his gradually failing eyesight kept him
              from continuing any extensive scientific work. He traveled little
              during this time and was further isolated from his contemporaries
              as the result of his public opposition to an 1874 taxation law
              that increased the tax on the monasteries to cover Church
              expenses. Gregor Mendel died on January 6, 1884, at the age of 61.
              He was laid to rest in the monastery’s burial plot and his funeral
              was well attended. His work, however, was still largely unknown.
